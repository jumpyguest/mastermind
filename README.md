# mastermind
A Mastermind game from the command line where you have 10 turns to guess the secret code as Codebreaker.
You also play as Codemaker for the computer AI to solve the code.

This project is implemented in Ruby as part of The Odin Project course.
I used Swaszek algorithm for the computer AI.
